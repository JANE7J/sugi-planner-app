  * **Cloud Firestore Database:** Securely stores all custom tasks and user preferences under a unique user ID.
  * **Custom Calendar Logic:** Features custom stickers, animations, and motivational quotes tied to user-defined personal dates (e.g., birthdays, anniversaries, care days).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

  * **Frontend:** React (CDN build with Babel)
  * **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (CDN)
  * **Backend:** Google Firebase (Authentication & Cloud Firestore)
